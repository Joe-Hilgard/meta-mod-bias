dataMA() calls expFinB() to generate data from biased studies.

expFinB() implements the QRP strategies of none, mod, and agg
It generates data using expFinU() if no p-hacking,
expDataB() if there is to be p-hacking.
expFinB controls the amount of p-hacking by implementing the 
optional stopping loop and sending arguments to analyB().

analyB() appears to be a biased analysis function.

The newest implementation appears to be "simMA()" not dataMA().
simMA does the censorfunc requested by our reviewers, so prob best to use that.
